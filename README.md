This is a selection of template projects to get up and running with for the Wheel Reinvention Jam. They are built on top of Handmade-inspired libraries (DearImGui, MicroUI, RayLib), Handmade-inspired languages (Odin), and SDL2.

For Odin files, use the latest nightly build of Odin, as the template code makes use of some newer Odin features and libraries.

For C/C++ templates, all required .lib files are included in the `libs` folder. On Windows, you'll want to run the build.bat script from the Visual Studio Native Tools Developer Prompt for x64.

We don't have a setup for Linux or Mac at the moment. The build for all of the templates is pretty simple, however, so if you're on those platforms, it should be relatively straightforward to build there too.

Most of the templates here were sourced from the examples provided with the aforementioned libraries.
